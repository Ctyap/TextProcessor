# TextProcessor
Created a Text Processing program. It reads a text files and returns a list of tokens (alphanumeric characters) in the file. Recorded the number of occurrence of each token and printed our word frequency count onto the screen.

Then wrote a program that takes in two text files from the command line as arguments and outputs the number of tokens they have in common.
